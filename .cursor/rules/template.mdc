# Generate code requirement

When generating code, describe why you write the go like this, either it is required by the user or you think it is best pratice. For example:

```go

// user ask to use optional as return type
// and also in this function, we should not return the error, exit the code as error occured.
// Remember, to check the optional cases while processing.
func Calculate() optional.Option[int] {
    
}
```

Remember, also list your thinking process as comment inside the code for future reference.
