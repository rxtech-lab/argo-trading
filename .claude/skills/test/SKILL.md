# Test

Run linting and tests to ensure code quality.

## Workflow

1. Run linting with `make lint`
2. Run tests with `make test`
3. Report results and fix any issues found

## Commands

### Lint

```bash
make lint
```

Runs `golangci-lint run ./...` to check for code quality issues.

### Test

```bash
make test
```

Runs `go test ./...` to execute all tests.

### Full Quality Check

Run both commands sequentially:

```bash
make lint && make test
```

## Handling Failures

- **Lint failures**: Fix the reported issues before proceeding
- **Test failures**: Investigate failing tests, check error messages, and fix the underlying issues
- Report a summary of results to the user
